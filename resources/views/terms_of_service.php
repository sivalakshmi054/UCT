									<strong>Fees and Payments:</strong>
								</p>
								
								<ul type="disc">
									<li>
										<p>
											<strong>Service Fees.</strong> We calculate and bill fees and charges, monthly for certain services while pay per use for others. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. We will invoice you from our registered office at the address of your establishment (as registered with the tax authorities, if applicable) receiving the Services in accordance with the applicable indirect tax. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Service Offerings as described on the Site using one of the payment methods we support. Payment will be due within 30 days from the date of our invoice. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff, or counterclaim, and without any deduction, or withholding unless required by law. Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the Site, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are using. You acknowledge that Authyn may display the applicable fees and charges for the Service Offerings on the Site in USD (or such other currency as Authyn may deem fit). However, Authyn will invoice you in INR calculated and converted in accordance with the conversion rate determined by us on the date of invoice ("INR Equivalent Fees"). You will only be liable to pay the INR Equivalent Fees indicated in each invoice.
											Any plans or costing, which we may be visible at our website can change at any instance, without prior information. They are charged based on the frequency of your usage of our services. Henceforth, if we find your usage being different than the package you have selected, we may change your package accordingly, that makes it obligatory for you to pay the rest of the amount, if not paid earlier.
											Also, each ‘service’ provided by a third party on Authyn website, except for the ‘free services’, will be costed separately (not included in any running scheme or packages).

											<strong>Taxes:</strong> All fees and charges payable under this Agreement will be exclusive of applicable national, state or local Indirect taxes ("Taxes") that Authyn is legally obligated to charge under the applicable. For the purpose of this clause, GST will include the Central Goods and Services Tax ("Central Tax"), the State Goods and Services Tax ("State Tax"), the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax ("UT Tax"), the Integrated Goods and Services Tax ("Integrated Tax") as may be applicable. The Taxes charged by Authyn will be stated in the invoice pursuant to applicable. Authyn may charge and you will pay any applicable Taxes, which are stated separately on the invoice. As per the statutory requirement under GST, you will provide all necessary information such as the correct GST registered address, legal name and GSTIN ("GST Information") in order for Authyn to issue correct GST invoices as per the applicable legal requirements. In the event, the GST invoice is incorrect, you will inform us in a timely manner, to enable Authyn to correct the GST tax invoice. Authyn will determine the place of supply for the Services based on the GST Information provided by you and accordingly, charge GST (CGST and SGST/UTGST or IGST) on its invoice. Any withholding taxes that may be applicable to the fees and charges payable to us are for our account. You will pay the fees and charges in our invoice in full (gross) without applying any withholding taxes. If you separately deposit applicable withholding taxes on such fees and charges to the applicable government treasury and issue us a withholding tax certificate evidencing such deposit, following receipt of the withholding tax certificate in original form, we will reimburse to you an amount equal to the taxes that are evidenced as deposited.

Any change in tax/service during that period does not comply the organization to refund the cost already paid. However, due to change in taxes made by the government under whose jurisdiction the office of the Authyn resides, the user is implied to pay the due taxes accordingly.
